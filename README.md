# Summary
This repository contains code for the analyses conducted in "Clinical features, genetics, and pathology in a large series of movement disorder cases: a retrospective multi-ancestry brain bank cohort study".
The aim of the study is to assess clinico-pathological correlation in individuals carrying disease-associated and risk genetic variants, the frequency of clinical misdiagnosis and the impact of co-pathology.

## Data Statement 
- All MDGAP/GP2 data are hosted in collaboration with the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Parkinson's Disease and are available via application on the website.
- The clinical and genetic data is available via the GP2 website (https://gp2.org). Genotyping imputation, quality control, ancestry prediction, and processing were performed using GenoTools (v1.3.5), publicly available on GitHub.
- Pathological staging and co-pathology data will be included in Release 11 of GP2, scheduled for December 2025.
